A heavily-documented example plugin for extending RAMP.  It transfers the email address from the General settings screen ("This address is used for admin purposes, like new user notification"), with much ado.

This plugin is not particularly useful in its own right; the admin notification email address does not frequently change, and the plugin requires that it be the only thing sent in a batch if it is to be sent.  However, the code does exercise a significant portion of the RAMP plugin functionality, and should serve as a reasonable base for developing a more helpful plugin.

== Installation ==

This plugin requires [RAMP](http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/ramp/) to function.

Upload it to the plugins directory and activate it through the Plugins menu.
